/** NODE.JS **/

- Platform, no UI component(no DOM), Open Source, 
- We can use JS in the server(It works without Browser)
- Node.js has API
- Browser is a sendbox which can not reach O.S., node.js can reach operating system via it's library
- Fast(online chat, zoom, online game),database query, realtime app., front-end and back-end
- Architecture
    ** node.js API( buffer, events, http, net, stream)
    ** Node.js Binding
    ** V8 Engine(js), C-ares, Libuv(library, eventloop, async), 

- System: App => V8 => Event Queue => Event Loop(async)=> Worker Threads

- Node is used in/ as Server: node .js has it's own built-in http server
- Nodejs can deliver data to all internet clients
- Frontend - Backend
- non-blocking I/O 
- event loop(single-thread) instead of Multi-Threads 
- callback functions
